# Lifecycle Aware Presenter
This repo serves as an example for my article [Lifecycle aware Presenter instead of LiveData](https://medium.com/p/f77d640115ef)

In addition in this project I have also used a couple of ideas like: 
* [autoClear()](https://thuytrinh.github.io/rxjava/android/2018/06/26/utility-auto-clear.html) to avoid writing boilerprate code for disposing RxJava disposables in Presenters   
* `@OpenForTesting` annotation with [kotlin-allopen](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html) to enable mocking kotlin classes during tests
* Passing `Provider<T>` in ViewModelFactories, so that instances of `T` for ViewModels are created only once, regardless of configuration changes
* All standard libraries: [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/), [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) and.. [AVLoadingIndicatorView](https://github.com/81813780/AVLoadingIndicatorView) (for fancy Progressbar)

Suggestions and comments are very welcome!
